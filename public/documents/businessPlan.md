## 1. Executive Summary

Company: Digital City Series (to be formalized as a German UG)

Founder: Bernard John Bolter IV

Website: www.digitalcityseries.com

**Funding Sought:** €30,000 for 15% to 20% equity

**The Opportunity:** The traditional art market is fracturing. Collectors, disillusioned by hype and speculation, are seeking authentic art with a direct connection to the artist. Concurrently, the market for affordable art ($1k-$5k) is thriving, growing 43% since 2019 to a \$13.3 billion online sector. Digital City Series is positioned to capture this demand by offering a new form of urban portraiture that is both deeply authentic and technologically innovative.

**The Product & Vision:** We transform the experience of a city into a cohesive visual narrative called Smoothism. Using a skateboard for mobility and a camera for capture, founder Bernard Bolter gathers thousands of images and sensory data from a city. This raw data is synthesized using proprietary AI-assisted techniques into a unified digital artwork.

Our unique production strategy bridges the digital and physical realms through a collaborative partnership with master artists from the Da Fen oil painting village in China. This allows us to produce high-end, one-of-a-kind oil paintings that translate our digital vision into the traditional fine art market, creating a unique and valuable cross-cultural offering.

Our core business model is the DCS100: an exclusive, limited circle of 100 collectors who receive a monthly limited-edition print for a recurring fee (€40-€50/month). This creates a predictable revenue stream and a loyal community, which is supplemented by sales from our oil painting collaborations and large-scale collector editions.

Our Differentiation: We are not another AI art generator or a traditional street photographer. We are the only operation combining:

- A 20-Year Archival Practice: A vast library of urban images and a proven artistic method.

- A Strategic Physical Production Pipeline: Exclusive collaborations with Da Fen artists for high-end oil paintings.

- A Defined Philosophy ("Smoothism"): A legitimate artistic movement that is a direct evolution of Cubism.

- A Sustainable Business Model: The DCS100 subscription ensures stability, avoiding speculative bubbles.

**The Ask & Use of Funds:** We are seeking €30,000 in seed funding to formalize the German UG, build out our proprietary AI "apprentice" to scale production, and execute a targeted marketing launch to fill the DCS100 subscription circle. This funding will be deployed in phases tied to clear milestones, moving the business from operational setup to sustainable growth.

**The Founder:** Bernard Bolter is a San Francisco-born, Berlin-based artist and developer with a 20-year multidisciplinary practice. His established relationships in Da Fen and unique background—spanning formal art education, grassroots entrepreneurship, and technical expertise—make him uniquely qualified to execute this vision at the intersection of art, technology, and global collaboration.

Digital City Series is more than an art project; it is a scalable platform built for the new art economy, leveraging technology and global partnerships to create sustainable value for creators and collectors alike.

> I grew up skateboarding in San Francisco in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, at the epicenter of a revolution. Skating broke free from abandoned pools and half-pipes, turning the city itself into our playground. Every stairset, curb, and ledge was no longer just a utilitarian object; it was a landscape of raw potential, an obstacle to be reinterpreted and ridden upon.

> I've carried that perspective with me ever since. When I started traveling the world, the skateboard became my essential tool, the one true way to learn a new city's topography. You could roll for miles, and it offered a sense of agency and kinetic mobility that walking could never provide.

> Getting my first digital camera set me free. No longer bound by the cost of film, I could document everything from every angle, capturing thousands of images as I skated through a city. This created a new problem—an overwhelming archive of visual data—but it also presented a profound new way of seeing.

> The Digital City Series was born from a single question that came to me right there on the board: Could I take the hundreds of images captured from this unique, kinetic perspective and synthesize them into a single, cohesive portrait? Could I build an image that didn’t just show a place, but that conveyed the visceral feeling of moving through it?

Digital City Series is a Berlin-based art and technology company that creates a new form of urban portraiture, transforming the kinetic experience of a city into collectible art. We bridge the gap between digital innovation and traditional craft through a proprietary process called Smoothism, offering authentic, accessible art directly to a global community of collectors.


### 2.1 - Mission Statement
***To transform our experience of the city into a new form of urban portraiture that bridges digital innovation and traditional craft, creating an art ecosystem where creators, communities, and collectors engage through art, storytelling, and collaboration.***

### 2.2 - Vision Statement
***To become a leading template for how artists can turn a creative series into a sustainable business, providing both a philosophical framework (Smoothism) and a proprietary platform for creators everywhere.***

### 2.3 - The Core Identity & Value Proposition
The company was founded on a principle of perspective shift. It applies the skateboarder's mindset—seeing potential where others see obstruction, and valuing flow over static observation—to the art of visual storytelling. We offer our collectors not just art, but a unique perspective and an entry into a curated cultural journey.

This foundational ethos extends to our use of technology; AI is not a shortcut, but a new terrain to be explored and mastered, much like the streets of San Francisco in 1989. Our direct-to-collector model bypasses traditional gallery structures, ensuring authenticity for the collector and sustainable economics for the artist.

### 2.4 - Products & Business Model
Our primary offerings include:

- The DCS100 Subscription: The core of our business, a limited membership providing monthly limited-edition prints, building a stable revenue stream and a dedicated community.

- Limited Edition Prints: Individual sales of archival prints at various sizes and price points.

- Oil Painting Collaborations: High-end, one-of-a-kind paintings produced in partnership with master artists from the Da Fen village in China, merging our digital origin with traditional fine art legacy.

- Future Licensing & Rental: Plans for corporate art rentals and licensing of our IP and platform.

We operate on a lean, direct-to-collector business model, leveraging our online platform and strategic partnerships to maintain high margins and a authentic connection with our audience.

### 2.5 - Legal Structure & The Offer
The company will be formalized under a German UG (Unternehmergesellschaft - haftungsbeschränkt), a structure chosen for its agility and low barrier to entry—reflecting the adaptive, resourceful spirit of its origins. The company will be headquartered at Charlottenburger Straße 8a, 14196 Berlin, Germany.

We are offering up to a 20% equity stake, seeking long-term partners who believe in the value of this unique perspective and are aligned with our mission to build a sustainable alternative in the art world.


## 3. Market Analysis
> In 2007, I presented the first Digital City concept at the Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. The work was just beginning—a single composition of Basel, Switzerland. The response was predictably mixed. One of the teachers, a respected figure, simply asked, “But is it art?”

> ​The question stung, yet it also brought a moment of profound clarity: art that challenges its era always meets resistance. Later that evening, I was with a friend and the creative director of Ogilvy in Amsterdam. When I told him what the teacher had said, he paused for a moment before replying. His response was immediate: “If a professor at the Rietveld has to ask if it’s even art, then it probably is.”

> ​That line has stayed with me. In 2007, digital art was a footnote, dismissed and mocked by many corners of the art world. Today, it drives billion-dollar conversations. Now, the same skepticism I heard then echoes in conversations around AI-assisted art: “Is it even art?”

> ​To me, this question is not a threat; it’s a validation. It is the surest sign that this project is precisely where it needs to be—on the cutting edge, just ahead of the curve.


### 3.2. The Explanation: Positioning in a Shifting Market

My experience at Rietveld was a microcosm of a much larger dynamic. For decades, cultural power in art was concentrated within a closed loop of elite institutions and a high-end gallery cabal. This system operated on exclusivity and often, market manipulation, leading to boom-and-bust cycles that have left many collectors feeling burned.

The NFT debacle was a watershed moment. It exposed the mechanics of hype and speculation to a mainstream audience, forever changing collector psychology. A new demand emerged: art must be authentic, accessible, and offer a direct connection to the artist and their process.

Concurrently, the data reveals a clear trend: while high-end "blue chip" art sales are faltering under their own weight, the market for affordable, non-blue chip art is thriving. Collectors are seeking value, meaning, and community outside the traditional gates.

My Strategic Waiting Position: Digital City Series is positioned explicitly outside of the tired high-end cabal.I am not seeking its validation; I am building an alternative model that serves this new market reality.

- I am lean and independent, like a tech startup disrupting an entrenched industry.
- I fill the cultural and value gap by offering authenticity (my 20-year practice), transparency (showing the AI process), and direct access to the artist (through the DCS100 subscription).
- My pricing is accessible, designed to build a broad collector base and create real value over time, not fuel speculative bubbles.

If the high-end art world comes calling, I will talk. But I am not waiting for them. I am positioned to capitalize on the major power shift that is already underway: the democratization of art collecting and the rise of artist-led ecosystems.

**A Right-Sized Model for a Long-Term Shift** - This trend identifies the above are not short-term fluctuations. They represent a fundamental, long-term recalibration of the art market's value system.

Therefore, this business is not designed as a *"blitz-scale"* startup. Instead, it is built as a right-sized, sustainable operation that is inherently valuable at its baseline. The core **DCS100** subscription model is engineered to provide operational sustainability with a lean structure from day one.

This creates a powerful strategic position: *I am building a valuable cultural asset and a dedicated collector community now, while consciously positioning myself to capitalize on a market shift that may unfold over the coming years. I am not betting on a sudden explosion; I am building a platform that is resilient, scalable, and patient. In essence, I am constructing a vessel that is seaworthy in the current climate but is also perfectly designed to catch the larger waves of cultural change when they arrive.*

### 3.3. Strategic Position: Landscape, SWOT, and Differentiators

This section provides a consolidated view of my competitive environment, internal capabilities, and unique market position.

Competitive Framework & Differentiation: I operate in a contested space,but my combination of pillars is unique. My competition falls into distinct categories:

- **Traditional Street Photographers (e.g., Vivian Maier estate, Alex Webb):** Masters of the decisive moment. I differ by synthesizing thousands of moments into a new "Smoothist" whole, augmented by technology and deep narrative.
- **AI Art Studios (e.g., Refik Anadol Studio):** Pioneers in data-driven, immersive AI art. I differ through my ground-level, photographic origin, focus on intimate physical collectibles, and a subscription model that builds community rather than offering one-off spectacles.
- **Artist-led Print Clubs (e.g., Austin Kleon):** Leaders in the direct-to-collector model. I differ by making the subscription the core of my business and integrating a complex tech stack (AI/AR) directly into the artistic product.

#### SWOT Analysis:

Strengths (Internal) Weaknesses (Internal)
• Unique artistic vision & IP ("Smoothism") • Proven first-mover advantage (since 2007) • Authentic story & personal brand • Hybrid high-tech/high-touch business model • Reliant on my creative output (key person risk) • Limited operational history under new UG structure • High upfront time investment per city series • Niche appeal may limit initial mass market reach

Opportunities (External) Threats (External)
• Long-term shift away from traditional art market • Growing collector interest in AI/tech-augmented art • Untapped B2B market for monumental works  • Expansion into new media (video, audio) • Economic downturn reducing discretionary spending • Potential for new competitors in AI-art space • Technological change (e.g., AR platforms evolving) • Cultural skepticism regarding AI's role in art

*Core Differentiator:* **Digital City Series** is the only operation combining my 20-year archival practice, a tech-forward (AI/AR) creation process, and a sustainable, community-focused (DCS100) business model to offer a new form of urban portraiture. I am not just selling art; I am selling a unique perspective and an entry into a curated cultural journey.

### 3.4. The Evidence: Market Data

This strategic position is supported by the latest market data. The 2024 Art Basel & UBS Report confirms the art market is intensely bifurcating. While the public auction value for works over \$10 million grew, it was fueled by a 25% contraction in the number of works sold in that category, signaling a risk-averse flight to a handful of established names [1].

Conversely, the market for affordable art is demonstrating robust, sustainable growth. The online art market has stabilized at a post-pandemic normal of **$13.3 billion**—a level **43% higher than in 2019**—with core strength in the $1,000–$5,000 range [2]. This growth is driven by a new generation of collectors who, disillusioned with market hype, prioritize authenticity, process, and direct artist engagement. My model is engineered precisely for this new, dominant market reality.

## 4. The Art

> My first Digital City was Basel, Switzerland. I began with a simple plan, a checklist of a city’s iconic structures: the church, the government building, and other landmarks I thought every city should have. I forced these pieces into the composition, and while the result was a finished piece, it felt like a static postcard, lacking any real life.

> Then came London. The same formula didn’t fit. The city resisted. The predetermined landmarks felt stiff and out of place amidst the raw energy I had captured while skating its streets. That’s when the epiphany hit me: I had to stop trying to dictate the city’s portrait and start listening to it. I began to let the visual data itself—the thousands of photos—guide the composition. The most compelling patterns, the most recurring textures, the very feeling of the place would determine the final image, not my checklist.

> This was the birth of the true method. With that shift, everything changed. The hundreds of "leftover" photos were no longer just outtakes; they were the evidence of the journey, the fragments of a story the city had been telling me before I learned how to listen.

### 4.1.

Every great art movement begins with a question. A century ago, Cubism asked: How can an artist break from a single, fixed perspective to represent a subject in a greater context? As a founding theorist of the movement, Jean Metzinger, who co-authored the first major treatise on Cubism in 1912 [1, 2], articulated a revolutionary idea—that the artist could move around an object, capturing *"temporally successive viewpoints and synthesizing them into a single, multifaceted total image"* . The quote from the movement's early theorists perfectly summarizes this:

​***"Cubist subjects are analyzed, broken up, and reassembled in an abstract form. Instead of depicting objects from a single perspective, the artist depicts the subject from multiple perspectives to represent the subject in a greater context."*** [^1]
​
​This project begins with a similar question, but in the digital age. If Cubism analyzed and fragmented reality to represent it in a greater context, can a new movement do the opposite? Can it synthesize a multitude of perspectives to represent a subject in a seamless, unified whole? The answer is Smoothism.
​
### 4.2. Smoothism: A New Visual Language for the Digital Age
***​Smoothism is the philosophical and methodological core of this project.*** It is a direct continuation of Cubism's pursuit of a higher reality, but it uses a new set of tools to achieve it.


**​The Method:** 
Where Cubism analyzed and broke up subjects to reassemble them in abstract form, Smoothism starts with synthesis. Through on-the-ground urban exploration, a multitude of perspectives—visual, auditory, and kinetic—are gathered. This process is a direct continuation of Metzinger’s "mobile perspective" but applied to the sensory-rich environment of the modern city.

**The Process:**
Technology, in the form of the "Homie AI," is employed as an apprentice. Its role is to analyze this immense data set, finding visual connections, patterns, and harmonies. This represents a profound shift from the manual, intellectual work of the Cubist artist, as the analytical delegation to an algorithm frees the artist to act as a guide and creative director.

**​The Result:** The artist guides the reassembly of these fragments into a new, hyper-cohesive, and unified whole. The final image is not a frozen moment in time, but a captured experience that conveys the visceral, simultaneous flow of moving through a city.

​In short, if Cubism is about deconstructing a subject through fragmentation, Smoothism is about reconstructing the essence of a subject through seamless, unified synthesis
​
### 4.3. The Homie AI: An Artistic Apprenticeship
The integration of AI is the essential evolution that allows this practice to scale. The "Homie AI" began not with a desire to generate images from prompts, but with a question: could an AI be trained on the specific visual language of my own archive? I treated it as an artistic apprentice. Its development is a phased, pragmatic process:

*Phase 1:* **The Digital Darkroom Assistant.** The top priority is to automate the manual, time-consuming pre-composition workload. The AI will automatically sort and group the ~50-70 panoramic scenes from a new city shoot and place them onto separate layers in a master Photoshop file, ready for manipulation. This phase alone will supercharge productivity.

*Phase 2:* **The Curatorial Eye.** The most complex artistic task is identifying which 2-4 scenes possess the visual harmony to be blended into a final composition. This phase may take years to fully realize, and I have a robust contingency plan. I will manually select the scenes, but I will meticulously record my audio commentary and on-screen actions, explaining every decision. This recorded process becomes the essential training data for the future.

*Phase 3:* T**he Blending Engine.** Once I have selected the scenes, the AI will handle the intricate work of aligning layers and creating initial masks, which I will then refine. This is a secondary priority after Phase 1, and I will record all my blending steps for future training.

### 4.4. The Creative Process: A Four-Stage Pipeline

The entire project is built through a meticulous four-stage process. Each stage is designed to generate the core assets for the artwork and the rich "Process Archive" that fuels our content ecosystem.

*Stage 1:* **Capture (The Data Harvest).** I skate through a target city with a camera, GPS tracker, and audio recorder. This generates high-quality street photos, video B-roll, GPS route data, and ambient audio—the raw data that forms the "Process Archive."

*Stage 2:* **Process (The AI Apprenticeship).** The AI model is trained on the specific visual language of that city. This generates screen recordings of the AI training, unique AI-generated patterns, and data visualizations of the model's learning.

*Stage 3:* **Compose (The Artist's Hand).** I guide the composition using AI-assisted tools in Photoshop. The AI suggests blends and matches, but I make the final aesthetic and narrative decisions. Narrated video commentary and time-lapses of the composition are recorded.

*Stage 4:* **Manifest (Digital-Physical Fusion).** The final digital artwork is completed, and the augmented reality experiences are developed.

### 4.5 The Micro, Meso, Macro Universe
The final artwork exists on a three-level scale, connected through Augmented Reality (AR) to tell a richer story:

- **The Micro (The Decisive Moment):** A single, square-cropped street photograph—a human-scale, fleeting moment that captures the city's soul.

- **The Meso (The Smoothist Composition):** The core artwork—a surreal yet realistic square composition of a city.

- **The Macro (The Satellite View):** A satellite image of the city, providing geographical context and grand scale.

Each of these tiers has a custom AR layer, accessible via a QR code, that unlocks the story behind the art, from seeing the AI's process to "riding" the skateboard route through Google Street View.

## 5.  The Product & Offerings

> After completing a handful of compositions—Basel, London, Venice, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas—I constantly wrestled with a central question: how could these digital pieces exist in the physical world? In the pre-NFT era, the very idea of monetizing digital work was uncommon. That's when I came across the Da Fen oil painting village in China, a place known for reproducing masterworks. I was intrigued not by the copies, but by the sheer volume of artistic energy there. I wondered, could my digital compositions be translated into oil paintings?

> With that idea, I traveled to China. I flew to Hong Kong, where I secured a visa to cross the border into downtown Shenzhen, a short subway ride away. There was no subway to the village yet, so I got the hotel staff to write the village's name in Chinese on a piece of paper, which I showed to the cab driver. Upon arriving, a giant sculpture of a paintbrush stood in the central square, from which countless small alleys extended, piled high with canvases and paintings. I walked the narrow streets for a while, unsure how to connect with anyone. Then, I passed a small gallery where an artist was painting outside. His work felt more personal than the reproductions I had seen.

> It was hot, so I sat down next to him. We connected through facial expressions and by looking at his work. I showed him the Digital Cities on my computer, and though neither of us spoke the other's language, a connection formed. Soon, he gestured, asking if I was hungry. I gave him a thumbs-up, and a moment later, his wife appeared with a meal for both of us. As we ate, two ladies walked by and started talking to us, one from Hong Kong and the other from London. One of them turned to the other and said, "Hey, look, there's an artist from San Francisco here!" Then she turned to me and, while I was eating noodles with chopsticks, asked, "How long have you been out here?" to which I replied, "Oh, about 45 minutes."

>The look on their faces was priceless. The woman from Hong Kong helped me translate and set up an appointment with the artist, whose name was Sanzi. We agreed to collaborate on an oil painting of Los Angeles, which turned out beautifully. Years later, Sanzi became a well-known artist with a gallery in Los Angeles. This made our early collaboration feel a bit prophetic and also revealed the true spirit of the painting village: not a factory for copies, but a place for artists to hustle, hone their skills, and make a living.

> This journey taught me that my digital work's potential was always in its ability to take on new physical forms. The challenge wasn't just in making art, but in creating a system that could connect my vision with an audience. This experience became the foundation for the diverse, physical products and offerings I am building today.

While the digital artwork is the heart of this project, the physical product is the body. The goal has always been to transform the digital into something tangible, collectible, and valuable. I learned this lesson years ago, at the Da Fen Oil Painting Village in China, where an entire community of artists meticulously reproduced the world's masterpieces by hand. It was a testament to the power of physical manifestation and the enduring value of a well-crafted object. This philosophy informs every one of the offerings in this series.

### 5.1 The Small Prints

The primary physical product is the small print, a 13" x 13" archival print of the main "Meso" composition.  These are also available for individual purchase as a valuable, small-ticket offering. Each print is part of a limited edition of 200 and comes with two 5" x 5" supporting prints—the "Micro" and "Macro" images—completing the three-part story. The prints are sized to fit into standard, affordable frames, making them accessible and ready to hang.

### 5.2 The DCS100 Subscription Program

The DCS100 is the foundation of the business model and the primary engine for building a loyal community and a predictable revenue stream. It is a highly curated, exclusive subscription program limited to just 100 members, divided into three distinct tiers.

#### Pricing & Tiers: The Monumental Arch

**Cornerstone (€40/month):** The first 25 members. They are the foundation of the entire community, the very first builders of the arch. This tier offers a €30 margin per order.

**Arch Stone (€45/month):** The next 25 members. These are the stones that form the main body of the arch, making it strong and complete. This tier offers a €35 margin per order.

**Capstone (€50/month):** The final 50 members. They are the top of the arch, the final, most crucial piece that locks the entire structure in place. This tier offers a €40 margin per order.

**Value & Margin:** The weighted average margin from a full DCS100 cohort is €36.25 per member/month. This predictable revenue stream is key to the business's sustainability and growth.

**Cost Structure:**
Per-shipment Variable Cost: Each monthly delivery costs an estimated €10, which includes €2.50 for paper, ink, sleeves, and swag, and approximately €7.50 for postage within the EU and US.
Quarterly Option: A quarterly shipping option offers a €5/month discount, which reduces monthly shipping costs while maintaining a similar profit margin.

### 5.3 The Oil Paintings: From Digital to Legacy
These one-of-a-kind oil paintings are a high-end offering that fuses the project's digital vision with the tradition of fine art painting. They are not simple reproductions but collaborative interpretations that represent a unique bridge between art forms. So far, four oil paintings have been produced, including one by a renowned artist named **Sanzi (Wang Xiaolong)**, a major figure in contemporary Chinese art who sells internationally.

The collaboration begins with a curated offering, where a set fee is given to the artist upfront, in addition to a 50/50 split of the profits once the work is sold. The paintings are offered in a standard 1m x 1m size and priced on a sliding scale starting at €1,000, with value appreciating based on the reputation of the artist. The website will have a dedicated section for each collaborating artist, telling their story and showcasing their work.

### 5.4 The Exclusive Collector's Editions
These limited-edition, large-format prints are a core part of the "wait game" pull marketing strategy. Their extreme scarcity builds long-term value and attracts serious collectors as the project gains momentum.

**The Monumental Works:** These 4' x 4' compositions, with their two 2' x 2' supporting pieces, are a highly exclusive series with an edition size of just three. Six of these works are already in prestigious collections, including one in the Capital One Digital Innovations collection and others in private collections in Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Marin County.

**The Collector's Prints:** The 30" x 30" prints, with their two 15" x 15" supporting pieces, have an edition size of just six. Nine of these prints are already in collections in Holland, Germany, and Portugal.
Both editions are offered with the option of being mounted on aluminum or as a print-only option.

### 5.5 The Traveling Collection & Art Rental
A key strategy to build exposure and a secondary revenue stream is to use the exclusive prints as a traveling exhibition. The project will maintain a separate inventory of prints, initially from the medium and large series, to be offered as rentals to corporate offices and businesses. 

In many European countries, companies can write off the rental of artwork as a business expense, making this a highly attractive and profitable opportunity. This strategy allows the project to simultaneously build an inventory of high-end works, generate revenue from their rental, and place them in high-visibility corporate environments for maximum exposure and interaction with potential clients. For ease of transport, a custom shipping box will be built for the entire collection.

Additionally, a separate collection of low-cost, full-size monumental prints will be created on durable banner paper. These will not be for sale but will be designed to be constantly shown as an exhibition in alternative spaces, including outdoor installations on the fencing around construction sites. A custom shipping box will be built to carry them with all supporting materials, enabling a constant, global exhibition.

### 5.6 Mass-Market & Engagement Offerings
**Zines:** A DIY zine will be produced for each city in a highly limited run of 20. Initially, these will be used as a lead magnet to get new subscribers to the newsletter.

**Books:** The project will continue its tradition of publishing books, including a special one dedicated to the oil painting collaborations. These books serve as a low-end offering that builds brand and narrative.

### 5.7 The Digital Certificate of Authenticity
Every artwork sold will come with a digital certificate of authenticity. This certificate can be registered on the project's website, providing a public and verifiable record of ownership. This digital record serves two crucial functions: it protects the collector's investment by proving the artwork's authenticity and it enables a transparent secondary market. The operational details of this system will be fully explained in a later section.

## 6 Marketing & Sales Strategy

> After completing about a dozen compositions, I felt it was time to get the work out into the world. A friend of mine was presenting at a PechaKucha event in Amsterdam. The format, a fast-paced presentation with 20 slides for 20 seconds each, originated in Japan and had become a global phenomenon. I decided to sign up, but I wasn't sure what to do. Then it hit me: I would freestyle rap about each city as its composition appeared on the screen. It was something I had grown up doing, and I hoped it would make the presentation interesting. My friend Rik from Amsterdam agreed to play the djembe for a beat, and we were set.

> The event took place at the Mediamatic arts center in the heart of the city, and the place was packed. I was nervous but got up there, made a short introduction, and then Rik started playing. I just started to rap. It went better than I could have imagined. According to the Mediamatic blog, the performance "stole the show with the longest applause and the loudest laughs." The reviewer found the performance "absolutely hilarious" and was surprised to hear anyone rap about Frank Gehry's architecture. The article commented that few other presenters came close to being that entertaining.

>I later went on to perform at PechaKucha events in Hamburg, Shenzhen, and San Francisco, always to a similar positive reception. This experience taught me a critical lesson: the best way to promote this project isn’t through traditional channels but through direct, personal, and high-energy engagement. It’s proof that I am willing to get on a stage and rap about this project to a packed house if I have to.

>Mediamatic. "Pecha Kucha Amsterdam #9." Mediamatic, 2007. [https://www.mediamatic.net/en/page/2249/pecha-kucha-amsterdam-9.]()

The Digital City Series will grow its audience and collector base through a multi-channel strategy that emphasizes authenticity, storytelling, and building direct relationships. This approach bypasses the traditional gallery system, which often takes commissions of 50% or more, allowing the project to build a more sustainable financial model. The primary first-year goal is to fill the DCS100 collector circle, which provides a core of sustainable monthly revenue and secures a dedicated audience that grows with the project.

### 6.1 Channels & Content Strategy
The content strategy is built on a tiered approach, with each channel serving a specific purpose:

**YouTube:** ***Art School with the Homie AI:*** The flagship media outreach will be the YouTube channel, blending long-form storytelling with problem-solving tutorials that show people how to train an AI on their own art. This content builds credibility in the innovation space and documents the creative process.

**Instagram & TikTok:** The Digital City Series content will be seamlessly integrated into the existing personal @Bernardbolter accounts. This approach allows for a single, focused content stream, ensuring a consistent narrative and efficient use of resources in the early stages. The project can dedicate social media specialists later for scaling.

**Newsletter:** The newsletter is solely dedicated to the Digital City Series and will serve as the primary long-term sales channel, providing first access and exclusive offers on works to high-end collectors. A pre-existing email list of approximately 300 past buyers will seed this channel.

#### Lead Magnet: 

**Limited Edition Zines:** The entry point for many collectors will be the limited-edition city zines. Designed as highly personal, story-driven artifacts, these zines will serve a dual purpose as both a brand asset and a lead magnet. Each zine edition is limited to 30 copies, plus one for the artist's archive, for each of the first 30 cities—a "30 for 30" release. They are a scarce reward for newsletter signups and are available free within the EU.

### 6.2 Events & Community Presence
The project will prioritize direct engagement and grassroots authenticity over traditional gallery representation. The strategy includes:

**Corporate & Office Rentals:** To build exposure and a secondary revenue stream, the project will maintain a separate inventory of the exclusive prints. A custom shipping box will be built for these collections, which will be rented to corporate offices and businesses. This strategy leverages the fact that many companies in the EU can write off art rental as a business expense, providing a profitable and high-visibility opportunity to place the work in front of potential clients.

**Pop-Up & Outdoor Shows:** The project will create dynamic, outdoor events using the large-format banner prints. These prints, which are not for sale, will be used to create temporary exhibitions on public infrastructure, such as the fencing around construction sites. These interventions provide visibility and a sense of creative autonomy, starting with launch events in San Francisco and Berlin.

### 6.3 Digital Archive and Auction House (DAAAH):
The website will feature a dedicated resale platform—**The Digital Archive and Auction House (DAAAH)**. This platform will allow collectors to re-list their authenticated works, from zines to prints and paintings. This feature adds a critical layer of value to every purchase by creating a liquid market, reinforcing the idea that these works are not just decorative but are tangible assets with appreciating value.

The DAAAH will be built and rolled out in stages. Initially, the onboarding process will be focused on the "Archive" element. Every zine and small print will ship with a digital certificate of authenticity, and an onboarding process will guide the customer to register their artwork. This instantly builds a user base with a vested interest in the platform.

The DAAAH's "Auction House" function will be introduced later. The first public auction will be for the free, limited-edition zines. Since these were given away, the auction is a subtle way to introduce value and demand, as a public price will be set. This controlled mechanism will drive the future pricing of the prints and paintings and demonstrates a powerful strategic use of a limited number of high-profile auctions.

Crucially, the long-term vision for the DAAAH is to open it to other artists whose work is aligned with the brand's aesthetic. This transforms the platform from a sales tool into a future business asset with significant scale and IP value.

### 6.4 The Sales Funnel & Year One Focus
The entire strategy is organized around a clear sales funnel that engages collectors from the very first touchpoint. 

The primary focus for Year One is to:

- Fill the DCS100.
- Launch the YouTube channel to establish credibility.
- Use the initial events and zine strategy to seed the newsletter and build a direct-to-collector platform.
- With this strategic foundation, the project is positioned not just as an art business but as a future platform business.

## 7. Operations

> While skating through Istanbul to capture photos for a new composition, I journeyed to the Bosphorus bridge. A smaller, winding road led down to a spot under the bridge, which looked like it might offer a unique viewpoint. As I rolled down the hill, my skateboard rattling against the asphalt, I suddenly saw a pack of eight to ten wild dogs on the side of the road. With the noise, I got their attention. We had a second or two of a wild-west showdown look, and then they started barking and running at me.

> I first started to run back up the hill, but I quickly realized I wasn't going to outrun them. I turned, skateboard in hand, and faced the pack. I wasn't sure what to do. I remembered a vague lesson about going after the largest dog to scare off the others, but they all seemed to be the same size. So, I started yelling as loud as I could, and then began banging the skateboard against the road railing next to me. The loud noise somehow worked. The dogs took off, and I went on my way up the hill.

> I’m not sure how that moment might have turned out, but it’s a story I’ve carried with me. It changed my path through the city, and shortly after, I got the pictures of the bridge for a scene that was used in the Istanbul composition. The entire experience was a perfect allegory for how I approach this project: expect the unexpected, be resourceful with the tools you have, and always be ready to face a risk head-on.


### 7.1 Production & Fulfillment

**​Zine Production:** Each zine will be a highly personal, handcrafted piece. They will be produced in-house in batches of 30, using a laser printer. The binding, signing, and digital registration will be done by hand, ensuring a direct and personal connection between the artist and collector. The estimated cost for materials, at most €1 per zine, aligns with the DIY, high-value, low-cost approach.

**Print Production (Small & High-End):** This dual-hub model in San Francisco and Berlin is a key operational advantage, minimizing shipping costs and delays.
​Small Prints: The existing setup in San Francisco uses a continuous ink system printer with archival ink and Epson Professional Matte Paper sourced from B&H in New York. The material cost per print is approximately €2-3. A similar setup will be established in a studio in Neukölln, Berlin, to service the European market. Orders will be fulfilled by family in SF and by the founder in Berlin, with plans to hire part-time help as demand grows. A planned trip to SF will restock supplies for both locations, creating a long production runway.
​
​​**​High-End Prints:** Relationships will be established with high-quality printers in SF and Berlin to ensure consistent, premium production according to industry standards. As the founder travels for future city compositions, a printing network will be grown by visiting local printers, allowing future sales to be fulfilled locally and reducing shipping costs on a global scale.
​Oil Paintings Production: The process for the oil paintings will follow the previously established model, leveraging the relationship with the artists from Da Fen to produce high-end, hand-painted replicas based on the digital compositions.
​
​**​Book Production:** To handle large-scale book productions, cultural knowledge and contacts in China will be leveraged to source reliable and cost-effective printing, drawing from past experience to secure the best deal.
​
### 7.2 Technology & Workflow
​
**​AI Workflow:** The creative process is powered by a strategic, cost-effective blend of in-house and cloud-based AI computing. The plan is to incrementally build a dedicated AI rig, leveraging used hardware to minimize upfront costs while retaining maximum control over the creative process. The AI will be built and trained piece by piece, and its development will be the central narrative of the YouTube channel.

**​Website & AR Production:** The website is the digital hub of the project, serving as the primary marketplace, archive, and community portal. It will be built on a modern, scalable tech stack using Next.js, Supabase, mind-js, and Snipcart.

**​Shipping & Fulfillment:** The shipping strategy is built on a dual-hub model in San Francisco and Berlin to ensure cost-effective and timely delivery to core markets. The website will integrate with a shipping platform like Shippo to generate live shipping quotes, and the packaging will be professional and include onboarding materials for the website.
​
### 7.3 Exhibitions & Events

**​Initial Exhibitions:** The first shows will feature only small prints, displayed in affordable IKEA frames, allowing for frequent, high-impact shows without significant overhead.

**​The Banner Collection:** Large-format, self-hanging banners will be sourced for approximately €50-€70 each. This collection will be built piece by piece and can be stored and later shipped to create multiple rolling exhibitions in different regions.

**​High-End Collections:** As the project evolves, the exhibitions will integrate one-of-a-kind, high-end pieces. The estimated costs are €200 for a small print and €800 for a large print, which will be produced with relationships established with local, high-quality printers.

**​Office Space Rental Program:** This will be launched later, once a small set of prints has been produced. The strategy involves a targeted, cold-calling campaign using a professionally designed brochure that highlights the value and benefits of the art rental.

## 8. Team

> After my time in Utrecht and before returning to the Rietveld, I moved to New York City. For five years, I worked on Houston Street in Manhattan, operating a large-format printer. In 2002, I got my first digital camera and began experimenting with it for my art. My job gave me access to printing on canvas, so I took countless photos and made surreal collages that I would print, and then paint over with acrylics.

> With this new series in hand, I needed a way to show them. I joined forces with four other artists who lived in my neighborhood in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Over a big bucket of chicken and a few beers, we came up with a name—Art Collision—and a plan to book our own exhibitions. We went on to show in New York, Baltimore, and Austin, Texas, before taking the project to Holland, where we showed in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Leiden.

> After our initial run, we decided to scale up. We brought in more artists and organized ourselves as a non-profit, with me as CEO. We put on shows with up to thirty artists in New York, San Francisco, and Denver. But we ran into trouble. It’s always difficult to sell artwork, and while many artists liked the idea of being a non-profit, we couldn't secure enough funding to sustain ourselves. I was always on the side of making it happen ourselves—learning to sell what we created and keep going. It was a hard message to get everyone on board with, and eventually, Art Collision dissolved.

> In the years that followed, I saw many artist-led, DIY collectives succeed. We had been a bit too early and, I realize now, our structure was too overextended to keep going. But the experience taught me invaluable lessons about leadership, collaboration, and the business of art. I can lead a group, and I'm a lot better at conveying a core goal now that I have this experience. My past challenges have prepared me to build this business with a focused vision for its future team.

The project is driven by a solo founder with a unique blend of creative, technical, and practical skills. The management strategy is built on a clear, phased hiring plan designed to free up the founder's time to focus on strategic growth and creative execution.

### 8.1 The Founder & Artist
I am the sole founder, and my background provides a unique foundation for this project. My experience spans over two decades in art, a formal education from art schools in Utrecht and Amsterdam, and a grassroots entrepreneurial spirit from my time leading a non-profit artists' group in New York. I bridge the gap between European artistic philosophy and the hands-on, DIY ethos of American art. 

My technical expertise as a self-taught programmer, proficient in modern web frameworks, allows me to personally manage all aspects of the initial website's development. My practical experience on construction sites in San Francisco gives me the unique ability to handle all physical production and exhibition needs, from building to lighting.

### 8.2 The Advisory Network
While a solo venture, the project is guided by a strong advisory network:
An Investor: Who will also serve as a business advisor, bringing strategic scaling expertise.

**Daniel Krause (Cultural Advisor):** An artist with three decades of experience in China who will advise on cultural nuances and translation.

**Alexander (Legal & Business Advisor):** A Berlin-based lawyer who will assist with business development and help connect the project to a cultural exchange program between Europe and China.

**An AI Advisor:** To be found through the project's YouTube series, who will provide guidance on the technical aspects of the AI workflow.
Community Collaborators: My network of top-tier professional skaters in Berlin and San Francisco will be a key asset for brand building and authentic community engagement.

### 8.3 The Phased Hiring Plan
The primary goal of the initial funding is to "buy back time." The team will be built in logical phases, with each hire directly addressing a key operational bottleneck.

*Phase 1:* **The Accountant.** An accountant will be brought on immediately to handle all business-related financials, ensuring the project's books are clean and organized from the very beginning.

*Phase 2:* **Print & Fulfillment Manager.** The first hire will be a part-time manager responsible for packaging, fulfilling print orders, and handling related customer communication. This will free up the founder from time-consuming, repetitive tasks.

*Phase 3:* **Social Media Manager.** Once a content runway has been established, a social media manager will be hired. Their responsibilities will include video editing, managing the content calendar, and engaging in social media communication.

**Long-Term Vision:** In later phases, a small, specialized team of freelancers and part-time help will be brought on as needed to assist with technical implementation (e.g., the auction house) and to manage a larger number of exhibitions.


## 9. Financials

>After my early trips to China and my move back to San Francisco, the project began to gain momentum. I had successful small shows, sold prints, and secured an installation in the Capital One digital innovations collection. Seeing this progress, I decided to run a Kickstarter campaign to fund a book. The campaign was a success, raising enough money for me to travel back to China and find a book manufacturer.

> My journey took me from Beijing to Shanghai to Guangzhou and Shenzhen, visiting book plants along the way. I was a bit green and had to navigate a lot of cultural differences in negotiation, but my biggest mistake was a technical one: I assumed on-demand digital printing was more advanced than it was. To meet the budget I had, the cost of the books was simply too high for the limited quantity I could produce. I eventually made a deal with a printer in Shenzhen and fulfilled the Kickstarter, but when I returned, the US economy had a slight downturn. Interest from galleries and corporate buyers stalled.

> This experience taught me a profound lesson about timing and overextension. I had poured a lot of my personal savings into a project that was, at that moment, too far ahead of the market. The financial strain was immense, and the technical burden of manually creating compositions and managing the growing archive became overwhelming. The project had to stop.

> Looking back, the failure was not a dead end—it was a lesson. The market for digital art was not ready, but it has since exploded. Now, with a clear understanding of my audience, a leaner business model, and the emergence of AI to lessen the technical burden, the time is finally right. This financial overview is not just a budget; it's a battle-tested strategy designed to build a valuable, sustainable business, not a speculative bubble.

The financial plan is built on a disciplined and conservative model designed to provide a clear path to profitability while managing risk. The core strategy is to invest in foundational infrastructure and then use a predictable revenue stream to scale the business organically.

### 9.1 The Funding Ask & Use of Funds
I am seeking €30,000 in seed funding, which will be deployed in a phased approach to reward early and long-term commitment.

#### Round 1 (€10,000) - 9% equity
**Use of Funds:** 

- Living Expenses (€6,000)
- AI Rig (€1,000)
- Business Setup (€1,000)
- Content Creation & Web Services (€2,000).

**Milestone to Unlock Round 2:** The website with AR and e-commerce functionalities is fully built, the AI automation pipeline is operational, and a 4-week social media content runway is in place.

#### Round 2 (€10,000) - 3% equity
**Use of Funds:** 

- Living Expenses (€6,000)
- AI Rig (€1,000)
- Travel & Production (€1,000)
- Print & Fulfillment Supplies (€2,000).

**Milestone to Unlock Round 3:** The project has reached 50 DCS100 members and has successfully executed the first exhibition in San Francisco, with a clear revenue goal met.

#### Round 3 (€10,000) - 3% equity
**Use of Funds:** 

- Living Expenses (€6,000)
- AI Rig (€1,000)
- Exhibition Materials (€1,500)
- Growth Fund (€1,500).

**Milestone to Be Achieved with Funds:** The project has reached the full DCS100 membership and successfully executed the first Berlin exhibition, showing a clear path to profitability and self-sustainment.

### 9.2 Break-Even Analysis
The break-even point is the number of units that must be sold to cover all fixed monthly expenses. The DCS100 subscription model is the primary driver of this calculation.

**Fixed Monthly Costs (Street Mode):** The monthly overhead for website hosting, software, and other basic services is approximately €100.

**Gross Margin Per Member:** Using the most conservative number from the "Cornerstone" tier, the gross margin is €30 per member.

**Break-Even Point:** To cover the €100 in fixed costs, the business would need to acquire approximately 4 DCS100 members. At this point, the business is self-sufficient and can survive on its own.

### 9.3 The Four Operational Scenarios
The financial model is dynamic and operates in four distinct modes, each with a different financial allocation and operational focus.

**Street Mode (Sustain):** The monthly gross margin is between €0 and €2,000. All funds are used to cover the minimum monthly expenses, with any surplus reinvested into restocking supplies and marketing to help the project reach Neighborhood Mode. No founder's fee is taken.

**Neighborhood Mode (Growth):** The monthly gross margin is between €2,000 and €4,000. A founder's fee of €500 is taken (rising to €1,000 at the €3,000 mark), and all remaining gross margin is reinvested into shows, new city creation, and marketing.

**Metropolis Mode (Scaling):** The monthly gross margin is between €4,000 and €6,000. The founder's fee is a consistent €2,000 per month. The remaining gross margin is used for a combination of reinvestment (producing high-end prints for exhibitions and the rental plan) and profit-sharing with the investor.

**Nexus Mode (Ultimate Potential):** The monthly gross margin is above €6,000. This represents the ultimate scaling potential of the business, with the founder and investor splitting a significant profit pool.

### 9.4 Financial Projections

#### Key Assumptions
**Product Pricing:**

- DCS100 (€40-€50/month)
- Single Prints (€75)
- Medium Prints (€1,000)
- Monumental Prints (€3,000)
-  Oil Paintings (€2,000)

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** 

- DCS100 & Single Prints (€10)
- Medium Prints (€200)
- Monumental Prints (€800).

**Overhead Expenses:** 

- Street Mode (€100/month)
- Neighborhood Mode (€1,000/month)
- Metropolis & Nexus Mode (€2,000+/month).

**Founder's Fee:** 

- Neighborhood Mode (€500-€1,000/month)
- Metropolis & Nexus Mode (€2,000/month).

**Sales & Growth:** DCS100 Churn Rate is assumed to be low (under 5% per month). Subscription growth is assumed to be slow and steady in the early stages, accelerating as the business gains momentum.

### 9.6 Financial Projections: Three Scenarios

> **Note:** All scenarios assume an initial €30,000 seed funding. The primary driver is the growth of the DCS100 subscription circle.

## 10. Risks & Mitigation

> This project has always been a series of calculated risks. I learned to embrace them long before I started, during a time when I was deciding on art school. I'd looked into art schools in the US and received some partial scholarships, but the high cost and the thought of taking on student loans for an art degree always gave me pause. I knew that in the US system, it was less about pure merit and more about if you had the money or were willing to take out the loans. In Europe, art schools operated differently: they were often free or had very low tuition, but admission was incredibly difficult.

> While back in San Francisco, after a couple of exploratory trips to Europe and having spent a lot of time in Amsterdam, I had secured an in-person application interview at the Rietveld Academie for the following spring. At the same time, I was speaking with teachers and the dean at the San Francisco Art Institute, and they told me I was a shoe-in for a full scholarship there, setting up an in-person interview. Then the letters with the official dates arrived from both schools. Both appointments were on the exact same day. I had to choose. I chose Amsterdam, believing it would be better for my art to expand my horizons. I packed up and put everything on the line, flying out for my single shot.

> This is where I truly learned the difference between the two systems. The art interview went well, and I later learned the admissions committee was impressed with what I brought. But the interview with the design faculty was a disaster. Lacking formal art education, I was grilled about my work and reacted poorly, using big English words that didn't land well with them. The rejection letter came while I was still there. I was crushed; my only plan had failed.

> My friend, who I was staying with at the time, mentioned another art school just thirty minutes away in Utrecht. I decided to try one more time. I went there, met the head of the art department, and he said I could try out the following week. At the school café, I spoke with a student for about a half hour, then went back to Amsterdam. The next week, I took the train back down to Utrecht and, by chance, met the same student on the train. I told him I was nervous because of the Rietveld experience, but he simply said it would be alright. He showed me the way to the school, we went in together, and then went our separate ways. When the admissions committee came into the room—two teachers and a single student—I realized the student was the same one from the café. At that moment, I knew I was going to art school in Utrecht.

> The experience was far better than I could have imagined. I met lifelong friends and became immersed in a society and culture that I wouldn't have known otherwise. This entire journey taught me that the biggest risks can lead to the greatest rewards. My track record isn't just one of success; it's a history of taking calculated risks, surviving setbacks, and ultimately creating a better path. This project is built on that very same principle, and my personal commitment is the greatest mitigation against its risks.

Every ambitious venture carries risks. In this case, the most significant one is clear: this project relies on a single artist to execute across multiple fronts—creation, storytelling, production, and outreach. Investors might reasonably ask: Can one person really do it all?

This reliance is not a weakness. It’s a defining strength. Unlike collective ventures that diffuse responsibility, this project centers on an individual with a proven record of resilience, adaptability, and commitment. Over the past decade, I’ve built and sustained a career that spans continents, navigated international art markets, and cultivated collectors who remain engaged years later.

I’ve also been here before, in other high-pressure creative arenas. Years of freestyle rapping eventually brought me onto stages in front of hundreds of people. In those moments, there is no second take, no editing, no delay. You deliver or you fail. I learned that I can deliver when the lights hit—not just once, but again and again.

The same mindset applies to the current moment in art and social media. I’ve watched the waves rise and fall, holding back from chasing every small ripple. That wasn’t hesitation—it was strategy. Without the right backend in place, catching a wave only to see it crash without momentum is wasted effort. Now, with the foundation of this plan and the right support, I am positioned to ride the big wave when it comes.

So let me finish by speaking directly.

This project is me. It’s my art, my story, my network, my resilience. I know what it means to grind, to risk, to show up when it matters. I’ve been preparing for years, and the only missing ingredient is this investment—the push that fills the sails and gets it all moving in sync.

I don’t take that lightly. My word is bond. I’ve built this to be sustainable, adaptable, and real. I’m committed to making this work—not just for me, but for everyone who comes along on the ride.

### 10.1 Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies
Founder Risk: The greatest risk is the project’s reliance on one person. I will mitigate this through a phased hiring plan that begins with an accountant and a fulfillment manager, reducing my workload and freeing me for high-value tasks. The AI workflow itself is a strategy to automate creation over time.

**Market Risk:** The art world's acceptance of new technologies can be slow, and it's difficult to know when a specific trend will "pop." The project’s business model is a key risk-mitigation tool. The project is designed to exist in a low mode and can continue to build and learn until the market is ready. The history of this project and the artist's persistence suggest that it is a question of "when," not "if," the market will catch up with the project's vision.

**Operational Risk:** The business relies on a number of physical products, and a failure in the supply chain could disrupt operations. The dual print hubs in San Francisco and Berlin are a key part of this mitigation, as they reduce shipping costs and protect the business from a single-point failure in a supply chain.

**Technological Risk:** The AI is a central component of the project’s long-term vision, but it may not be ready to accomplish its full, planned functionality. The AI workflow is designed as a phased, long-term development project, not as a single point of failure. The AI’s development process will be a central part of the YouTube channel's narrative, building a dedicated following and anticipation for the day the AI is ready, and turning the development process itself into a key marketing asset.


## 11. Future Vision

> I was in Lisbon, Portugal, skating around the city to take pictures for a new Digital City composition. On the third day of my mission, I took a break to grab a sandwich at a local shop. I started a conversation with a local dude, and he thought it was cool that I was exploring his city on a skateboard. Before I left, he asked me if I wanted to be in a rap video he was filming the next day. I figured, "Why not?" and we made a plan to meet.

> He showed up the next day with two other guys to help with the filming. They didn't have a solid plan, so we brainstormed over coffee. One of them had an alien mask and said, "I'll just put this on and chase you around town on your skateboard." We spent the rest of the day traveling all over the city, filming and skating. It was an amazing time. We ended up at the plaza on the water, the iconic gateway to the city, where we filmed a couple of different endings as the sun went down.

> The rappers name was Jazzy J, and the video was called "Street Brothers." That day showed me something profound: skateboarding is more than just a sport; it is a passport to the world. This project is rooted in stories like that, and its ultimate goal is to create more of them.

The long-term vision for this project is to create a full-circle connection with the skateboarding community that inspired it all. This final phase of the project will begin once the "Homie AI" has perfected its three-stage process: automation, masking, and selection.

Once the AI is fully capable, the project will be opened to professional skaters and skaters from their local cities. The process will be a collaboration. I will be on the ground with them, filming their skate tricks and guiding them through the process of capturing the fast-paced, back-to-back photographs needed to create a Digital City. The skaters will provide the visual material, and the "Homie AI" will handle the composition.

The final product will be a unique series of art and skating videos. The videos will be cut in a style inspired by skate videos, with quick, dynamic edits of skate tricks intercut with the same fast-paced, back-to-back shots of a city being captured for a composition.

This cross-pollination will create a truly unique art form and a powerful marketing tool. From there, the possibilities are vast. This project's main focus is to start and end its initial part with skateboarding, which is where the entire perspective and ethos that carries the project forward comes from.
