## 1. Executive Summary

Company: Digital City Series (to be formalized as a German UG)

Founder: Bernard John Bolter IV

Website: www.digitalcityseries.com

**Funding Sought:** €30,000 for 15% to 20% equity

**The Opportunity:** The traditional art market is fracturing. Collectors, disillusioned by hype and speculation, are seeking authentic art with a direct connection to the artist. Concurrently, the market for affordable art ($1k-$5k) is thriving, growing 43% since 2019 to a \$13.3 billion online sector. Digital City Series is positioned to capture this demand by offering a new form of urban portraiture that is both deeply authentic and technologically innovative.

**The Product & Vision:** We transform the experience of a city into a cohesive visual narrative called Smoothism. Using a skateboard for mobility and a camera for capture, founder Bernard Bolter gathers thousands of images and sensory data from a city. This raw data is synthesized using proprietary AI-assisted techniques into a unified digital artwork.

Our unique production strategy bridges the digital and physical realms through a collaborative partnership with master artists from the Da Fen oil painting village in China. This allows us to produce high-end, one-of-a-kind oil paintings that translate our digital vision into the traditional fine art market, creating a unique and valuable cross-cultural offering.

Our core business model is the DCS100: an exclusive, limited circle of 100 collectors who receive a monthly limited-edition print for a recurring fee (€40-€50/month). This creates a predictable revenue stream and a loyal community, which is supplemented by sales from our oil painting collaborations and large-scale collector editions.

Our Differentiation: We are not another AI art generator or a traditional street photographer. We are the only operation combining:

- A 20-Year Archival Practice: A vast library of urban images and a proven artistic method.

- A Strategic Physical Production Pipeline: Exclusive collaborations with Da Fen artists for high-end oil paintings.

- A Defined Philosophy ("Smoothism"): A legitimate artistic movement that is a direct evolution of Cubism.

- A Sustainable Business Model: The DCS100 subscription ensures stability, avoiding speculative bubbles.

**The Ask & Use of Funds:** We are seeking €30,000 in seed funding to formalize the German UG, build out our proprietary AI "apprentice" to scale production, and execute a targeted marketing launch to fill the DCS100 subscription circle. This funding will be deployed in phases tied to clear milestones, moving the business from operational setup to sustainable growth.

**The Founder:** Bernard Bolter is a San Francisco-born, Berlin-based artist and developer with a 20-year multidisciplinary practice. His established relationships in Da Fen and unique background—spanning formal art education, grassroots entrepreneurship, and technical expertise—make him uniquely qualified to execute this vision at the intersection of art, technology, and global collaboration.

Digital City Series is more than an art project; it is a scalable platform built for the new art economy, leveraging technology and global partnerships to create sustainable value for creators and collectors alike.

> I grew up skateboarding in San Francisco in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, at the epicenter of a revolution. Skating broke free from abandoned pools and half-pipes, turning the city itself into our playground. Every stairset, curb, and ledge was no longer just a utilitarian object; it was a landscape of raw potential, an obstacle to be reinterpreted and ridden upon.

> I've carried that perspective with me ever since. When I started traveling the world, the skateboard became my essential tool, the one true way to learn a new city's topography. You could roll for miles, and it offered a sense of agency and kinetic mobility that walking could never provide.
> 
Getting my first digital camera set me free. No longer bound by the cost of film, I could document everything from every angle, capturing thousands of images as I skated through a city. This created a new problem—an overwhelming archive of visual data—but it also presented a profound new way of seeing.
>  
The Digital City Series was born from a single question that came to me right there on the board: Could I take the hundreds of images captured from this unique, kinetic perspective and synthesize them into a single, cohesive portrait? Could I build an image that didn’t just show a place, but that conveyed the visceral feeling of moving through it?

Digital City Series is a Berlin-based art and technology company that creates a new form of urban portraiture, transforming the kinetic experience of a city into collectible art. We bridge the gap between digital innovation and traditional craft through a proprietary process called Smoothism, offering authentic, accessible art directly to a global community of collectors.

### 2.1 - Mission Statement
***To transform our experience of the city into a new form of urban portraiture that bridges digital innovation and traditional craft, creating an art ecosystem where creators, communities, and collectors engage through art, storytelling, and collaboration.***

### 2.2 - Vision Statement
***To become a leading template for how artists can turn a creative series into a sustainable business, providing both a philosophical framework (Smoothism) and a proprietary platform for creators everywhere.***

### 2.3 - The Core Identity & Value Proposition
The company was founded on a principle of perspective shift. It applies the skateboarder's mindset—seeing potential where others see obstruction, and valuing flow over static observation—to the art of visual storytelling. We offer our collectors not just art, but a unique perspective and an entry into a curated cultural journey.

This foundational ethos extends to our use of technology; AI is not a shortcut, but a new terrain to be explored and mastered, much like the streets of San Francisco in 1989. Our direct-to-collector model bypasses traditional gallery structures, ensuring authenticity for the collector and sustainable economics for the artist.

### 2.4 - Products & Business Model
Our primary offerings include:

- The DCS100 Subscription: The core of our business, a limited membership providing monthly limited-edition prints, building a stable revenue stream and a dedicated community.

- Limited Edition Prints: Individual sales of archival prints at various sizes and price points.

- Oil Painting Collaborations: High-end, one-of-a-kind paintings produced in partnership with master artists from the Da Fen village in China, merging our digital origin with traditional fine art legacy.

- Future Licensing & Rental: Plans for corporate art rentals and licensing of our IP and platform.

We operate on a lean, direct-to-collector business model, leveraging our online platform and strategic partnerships to maintain high margins and a authentic connection with our audience.

### 2.5 - Legal Structure & The Offer
The company will be formalized under a German UG (Unternehmergesellschaft - haftungsbeschränkt), a structure chosen for its agility and low barrier to entry—reflecting the adaptive, resourceful spirit of its origins. The company will be headquartered at Charlottenburger Straße 8a, 14196 Berlin, Germany.

We are offering up to a 20% equity stake, seeking long-term partners who believe in the value of this unique perspective and are aligned with our mission to build a sustainable alternative in the art world.
