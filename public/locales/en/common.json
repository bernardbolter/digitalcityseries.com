    "description": "From the streets of San Francisco and Berlin, artist Bernard Bolter transforms the chaos of the city into unified, high-definition art. This project is rooted in the kinetic energy of skateboarding, using a unique approach to gather visual data that goes beyond a single moment. The final artwork—from large-scale prints to masterfully executed oil paintings—is a cohesive narrative of the urban experience that you can own."

    "introText": "The Digital City Series is an art project that creates portraits of cities. Instead of showing a single photo of a famous building, each portrait combines hundreds of street-level photos into one square image. The result is a unique view of a city that feels like moving through it.",
    "methodText": "The project started in 2007. I use a skateboard to explore cities, which gives a fast, fluid perspective. I take thousands of pictures on these journeys. Back in the studio, I blend these photos together into a single, seamless composition.",
    "philosophyText": "This method is inspired by Cubist painters, who showed objects from many angles at once. My work does something similar for the modern city, using digital tools. This process, which I call **Smoothism**, uses technology to help manage and find connections in all the visual information.",
    "collaborationsText": "Over the years, the project has grown to include collaborations with traditional oil painters in China, turning the digital images into physical paintings. This connects new technology with classic art skills.",
    "relaunchText": "The project is starting again now because the world is more ready for it. People are interested in how art and technology can work together, and they want authentic stories from artists. After years of development, the time is right to share these city portraits with a wider audience.",

    "originStory": "The journey to Da Fen began with a question: how could my digital city compositions exist in the physical world? I traveled to the renowned oil painting village in Shenzhen, a place pulsing with artistic energy, and found myself sharing a meal with an artist named Sanzi (Wang Xiaolong). Without a common language, we connected through the images on my laptop. This meeting sparked our first collaboration—a beautiful oil painting of Los Angeles—and laid the foundation for a unique cross-cultural bridge.",
    "collaborationProcess": "Today, that initial connection has evolved into a core part of Digital City Series. We collaborate with master artists in Da Fen to translate our digital 'Smoothist' visions into one-of-a-kind oil paintings. This is not mere reproduction; it is a reinterpretation. The artists bring their profound understanding of texture, light, and the physicality of paint, adding a new, tactile layer to the original digital work.",
    "artisticSignificance": "These collaborations represent a unique fusion of the digital and the traditional art worlds. They are a testament to the idea that innovation and legacy can coexist, creating something entirely new. Each painting is a bridge—connecting my digital perspective with centuries of analog craft, and linking the forward momentum of Berlin with the skilled hands of Da Fen."
